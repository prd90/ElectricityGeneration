# CS 4331/5331 Project 3 Proposal
### _"Electricity Generation from Natural resources"_

## Team Members:
1. Amitsingh Paredeshi
2. Jonatha Bouligny
3. Prerit Datta

### Aim of the Project
The app will educate children how electricity is generated from sources such as wind, solar power and a water turbine.


### Project Description
1. We plan to use scientific and real time data such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed etc. to calculate the amount of electricity generated by Wind mill. The formula for calculating Wind Power can be found here: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wind-power-d_1214.html (it uses air density). The weather data can be found at: http://w1.weather.gov/obhistory/KLBB.html. We’re thinking about calculating the power efficiency based on a data for 1 week.
 
2. We also wish to demonstrate a model for electricity generation using water turbines. We intend to use scientific formula such as found on: http://www.wvic.com/content/how_hydropower_works.cfm. We’re thinking of allowing player to adjust the parameters such as dam height etc. and see the corresponding impact on electricity generated.
 
3. For Electricity generation using Solar panels, we can calculate electricity generated relative to sun’s altitude. We will include a day-night cycle and display the power generated at the end of the day. Player will be able to adjust the solar panel height for more efficiency.
